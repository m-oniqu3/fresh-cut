## Description

This is a single page website for a fictional barber shop called Fresh Cut. It was created using HTMl, SCSS and Javascript. It provides information on the background of the company, the services it provides to its clients and contact information. It also provides information on each barber and why clients should book with them.

## Motivation

After recently revised SASS, I had a better understanding of SASS, its features and its benefits. I'm big on organization and I was excited to learn about the [7â€“1 Architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) that SASS uses to structure SASS projects to make it easier to organize stylesheets and manage a project as it grows.

I wanted to build a simple website to practise these new concepts that I learned. I also wanted to build a project using the [BEM Naming Convention](http://getbem.com/) and this was a great opportunity to do so.
